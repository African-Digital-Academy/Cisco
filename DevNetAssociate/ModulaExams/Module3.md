What is network programmability?

the ability to configure, monitor, and react to events in the network in real time

the ability to configure virtualized networks and deploy virtualized services in real time

the ability to easily monitor network devices using traditional network protocols

the ability to program network devices using repetitive manual configuration via a terminal and command sets
Network programmability refers to the ability to configure and manage network devices using software-based techniques and tools, such as APIs, scripts, and automation frameworks. It involves using programming concepts and techniques to automate network configurations, monitor network events, and perform network operations. Network programmability enables organizations to build more agile, scalable, and efficient networks by abstracting network functionality and infrastructure as software components that can be easily managed and controlled. Therefore, the first option, "the ability to configure, monitor, and react to events in the network in real time," is the closest definition to network programmability.

What are two benefits of using APIs and integrations between applications? (Choose two.)

Integrations enable the applications to be installed on any operating system type.

Integrations enable the applications to run a Docker instance using Hyper-V.

Integrations are used to provide applications the ability to notify each other when a specific event happens.

Integrations are used to verify compatibility between different applications.

Integrations enable the applications to request actions from each other.
Navigation Bar
Two benefits of using APIs and integrations between applications are:

Integrations enable the applications to request actions from each other: Integrating applications using APIs allows them to interact with each other and request actions, data or functionality from one another, enabling them to work together seamlessly and efficiently.

Integrations are used to provide applications the ability to notify each other when a specific event happens: Integrating applications with each other using APIs enables them to share information and notify each other of important events in real-time. For example, when an order is placed on an e-commerce website, the order management system can be notified instantly, allowing it to process the order and notify the customer of its status.

A student is learning Python using the interactive interpreter mode. The student issues these commands:

>>> class Url():
... def __init__(self, host, prot):
... self.host = host
... self.prot = prot
... self.url = self.prot + "://" + self.host
...
>>>

Which command should the student use to create an object with one attribute being a valid URL?

>>> url2 = Url('http', 'www.cisco.com')

>>> url2 = Url('http', '://', 'www.cisco.com')

>>> url2 = Url('www.cisco.com', 'http')

>>> url2 = Url(URL, 'http://', 'www.cisco.com')
The correct command to create an object with one attribute being a valid URL would be:

python
Copy code
>>> url2 = Url('www.cisco.com', 'http')
This is because the __init__ method in the Url class takes two parameters, host and prot, which represent the hostname and protocol respectively. Therefore, when creating an object of the Url class, we need to pass values for both these parameters in the correct order. In this case, the hostname is 'www.cisco.com' and the protocol is 'http', so we pass them in that order.
