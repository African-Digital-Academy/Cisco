What is network programmability?

the ability to configure, monitor, and react to events in the network in real time

the ability to configure virtualized networks and deploy virtualized services in real time

the ability to easily monitor network devices using traditional network protocols

the ability to program network devices using repetitive manual configuration via a terminal and command sets
Network programmability refers to the ability to configure and manage network devices using software-based techniques and tools, such as APIs, scripts, and automation frameworks. It involves using programming concepts and techniques to automate network configurations, monitor network events, and perform network operations. Network programmability enables organizations to build more agile, scalable, and efficient networks by abstracting network functionality and infrastructure as software components that can be easily managed and controlled. Therefore, the first option, "the ability to configure, monitor, and react to events in the network in real time," is the closest definition to network programmability.

What are two benefits of using APIs and integrations between applications? (Choose two.)

Integrations enable the applications to be installed on any operating system type.

Integrations enable the applications to run a Docker instance using Hyper-V.

Integrations are used to provide applications the ability to notify each other when a specific event happens.

Integrations are used to verify compatibility between different applications.

Integrations enable the applications to request actions from each other.

Two benefits of using APIs and integrations between applications are:

Integrations enable the applications to request actions from each other: Integrating applications using APIs allows them to interact with each other and request actions, data or functionality from one another, enabling them to work together seamlessly and efficiently.

Integrations are used to provide applications the ability to notify each other when a specific event happens: Integrating applications with each other using APIs enables them to share information and notify each other of important events in real-time. For example, when an order is placed on an e-commerce website, the order management system can be notified instantly, allowing it to process the order and notify the customer of its status.

Which technology trend enables an industry shift towards automation, applications, and integrations?

increased storage and RAM

increased internet connection bandwidth

smaller and faster CPUs

advanced API capabilities
Navigation Bar
Advanced API capabilities enable an industry shift towards automation, applications, and integrations. APIs, or application programming interfaces, provide a standardized way for software applications to interact with each other, allowing them to exchange data and functionality seamlessly. By leveraging APIs, organizations can automate processes, integrate applications, and build custom solutions that meet their specific needs. The advanced capabilities of APIs, such as webhooks and event-driven architecture, have made it easier than ever to build complex integrations between applications, enabling organizations to unlock new levels of productivity and innovation. Therefore, option "advanced API capabilities" is the correct answer to this question.
