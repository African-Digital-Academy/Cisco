Which underlying technology makes it possible for Cisco Umbrella to prevent a user from accessing a blocked site?

DHCP

DNS

HTTP and HTTPS

Cisco Firewall
Cisco Umbrella prevents a user from accessing a blocked site by leveraging the DNS (Domain Name System) protocol. When a user tries to access a website, Cisco Umbrella checks the domain name against its list of blocked domains. If the domain is on the list, the request is blocked and the user is redirected to a block page. If the domain is not on the list, the request is allowed and the user is able to access the site.

Cisco UCS Manager uses service profiles as templates to provision policies to multiple versions of the same server.

Cisco UCS Manager saves service profiles to recover servers in case of data loss.

Cisco USC Manager uses an assigned service profile to each instance to define network policy.
Navigation Bar
Cisco UCS Manager uses service profiles as templates to provision policies to multiple versions of the same server. A service profile contains the server's identity, policies for configuring the server's hardware and firmware, and the boot policy. By using service profiles, administrators can easily and consistently deploy servers with the correct configuration and policies, reducing the risk of errors and improving the efficiency of server deployment. Additionally, if a server needs to be replaced or upgraded, the same service profile can be applied to the new server, ensuring that it is configured correctly.

Why does the Meraki dashboard API return a 404 rather than a 403 code in response to a request with an invalid API key?

The 404 return code prevents the system from indicating the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

The 403 return code would indicate that there are no resources at that endpoint but the API key could be correct.

The 403 return code would indicate that the client definitely has an invalid API key.

The 404 return code determines whether unauthorized users will try again.
Navigation Bar
The Meraki dashboard API returns a 404 (Not Found) status code rather than a 403 (Forbidden) status code in response to a request with an invalid API key because the 404 status code prevents the system from indicating the existence of resources to unauthorized users. If a 403 status code were returned, an attacker could use that information to guess whether resources exist at that endpoint and continue to make requests until they found a valid endpoint, increasing the risk of a successful attack. By returning a 404 status code, the system masks whether the resource exists or not and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to resources.

What are two types of YANG models? (Choose two.)

open model

hybrid model

private model

native model

vendor model
The two types of YANG models are:

Native model: A native model is a YANG model that is defined and maintained by a standards organization or an open-source community. Native models define standard data models for network devices, protocols, and services, and are intended to be interoperable across different vendor implementations.

Vendor model: A vendor model is a YANG model that is developed and maintained by a network equipment vendor to define the data model for its own products and services. Vendor models can extend native models, provide additional functionality, or define proprietary data models specific to the vendor's products.

Therefore, the correct options are "native model" and "vendor model."
