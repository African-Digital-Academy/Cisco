In what two situations would UDP be the preferred transport protocol over TCP? (Choose two.)

when applications do not need to guarantee delivery of the data

when a faster delivery mechanism is needed

when applications need to guarantee that a packet arrives intact, in sequence, and unduplicated

when delivery overhead is not an issue

when destination port numbers are dynamic
The two situations where UDP would be the preferred transport protocol over TCP are:

When applications do not need to guarantee delivery of the data.
When a faster delivery mechanism is needed.
UDP is a faster and simpler protocol that does not guarantee the delivery of data. Therefore, it is suitable for applications where speed is more important than reliability, such as in real-time applications like VoIP and video streaming. Additionally, UDP is often used when the overhead of establishing a TCP connection and managing the flow control is not necessary, and where packet loss can be tolerated or handled by the application layer.

Which two OSI model layers have the same functionality as two layers of the TCP/IP model? (Choose two.)

transport

session

network

data link

physical
The two OSI model layers that have the same functionality as two layers of the TCP/IP model are:

Transport layer
Network layer
The transport layer in the OSI model is equivalent to the transport layer in the TCP/IP model. Both layers provide end-to-end data transfer services and handle issues related to flow control, error recovery, and congestion control.

The network layer in the OSI model is equivalent to the internet layer in the TCP/IP model. Both layers are responsible for addressing and routing data packets between networks, and provide services such as packet fragmentation and reassembly, error checking, and traffic control.

Refer to the exhibit. A computer that is configured with the IPv4 address as shown in the exhibit is unable to access the internet. What is the problem?​

The gateway address is in the wrong subnet.

The IP address is a broadcast address.

The settings were not validated.

The IP address is a network address.
Based on the exhibit, the problem is that the gateway address is in the wrong subnet.

The IP address of the computer is 192.168.1.100 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which means that it is in the subnet 192.168.1.0/24. However, the gateway address configured on the computer is 192.168.0.1, which is not in the same subnet. The gateway address should be in the same subnet as the IP address of the computer, which is 192.168.1.x.

Therefore, the computer is unable to access the internet because it cannot communicate with the gateway, which is in a different subnet. The gateway address needs to be updated to an address within the correct subnet for the computer to be able to access the internet.

What will a host on an Ethernet network do if it receives a frame with a unicast destination MAC address that does not match its own MAC address?

It will remove the frame from the media.

It will forward the frame to the next host.

It will strip off the data-link frame to check the destination IP address.

It will discard the frame.
Navigation Bar
If a host on an Ethernet network receives a frame with a unicast destination MAC address that does not match its own MAC address, it will discard the frame.

Ethernet networks use MAC addresses to uniquely identify hosts on the network. When a host receives a frame with a unicast destination MAC address, it compares the destination MAC address with its own MAC address. If the destination MAC address does not match its own MAC address, the host will assume that the frame is intended for another host on the network and will discard it.

Refer to the exhibit. An organization is using static NAT to translate the private IP address of Host A to a single public IP address leased from the ISP. Which address is the inside global address of Host A?
https://assessment.netacad.net/assessment/images/i264430v7n1_264430.gif

209.165.202.129

203.0.113.2

192.168.2.253

192.168.1.1

192.168.1.10
Based on the exhibit, the inside global address of Host A is 209.165.202.129.

Static NAT is used to map a single private IP address to a single public IP address. In this case, the private IP address of Host A is 192.168.1.10, and it is being translated to the public IP address 209.165.202.129.

The inside global address is the public IP address that represents the inside local address (private IP address) of the host on the outside network (internet). In this case, 209.165.202.129 is the public IP address that represents the private IP address of Host A (192.168.1.10) on the outside network (internet).

What type of address is 01-00-5E-0A-00-02?

an address that reaches a specific group of hosts

an address that reaches every host in the network

an address that reaches every host inside a local subnet

an address that reaches one specific host
Navigation Bar
The address 01-00-5E-0A-00-02 is a multicast address that reaches a specific group of hosts.

Multicast is a network communication mechanism that allows a single packet to be sent to a group of hosts on the network. The destination MAC address 01-00-5E-0A-00-02 is a reserved multicast address in Ethernet networking, which corresponds to the IPv4 multicast address 224.10.0.2.

Therefore, if a packet with this destination MAC address is sent on the network, it will be received by all hosts that have joined the corresponding multicast group (224.10.0.2) and have their network interface configured to listen to the multicast traffic.

Consider the following routing table entry for R1:

D 10.1.1.0/24 [90/2170112] via 209.165.200.226, 00:00:05, Serial0/0/0

What is the significance of the Serial0/0/0?

It is the interface on the final destination router that is directly connected to the 10.1.1.0/24 network.

It is the interface on R1 used to send data that is destined for 10.1.1.0/24.

It is the interface on the next-hop router when the destination IP address is on the 10.1.1.0/24 network.

It is the R1 interface through which the EIGRP update was learned.
Navigation Bar
The Serial0/0/0 in the routing table entry for R1 indicates the interface used to send data that is destined for the 10.1.1.0/24 network.

In this entry, the "via" keyword indicates the next-hop router used to reach the destination network, which is 209.165.200.226. The interface used to reach this next-hop router is Serial0/0/0. Therefore, when R1 receives traffic that is destined for the 10.1.1.0/24 network, it will forward the traffic out of its Serial0/0/0 interface towards the next-hop router 209.165.200.226, which will then forward the traffic to the final destination on the 10.1.1.0/24 network.

So, the Serial0/0/0 interface in the routing table entry for R1 is the interface used to send data that is destined for the 10.1.1.0/24 network through the next-hop router.

A device has an IPv6 address listed as 2001:0DB8:75a3:0214:0607:1234:aa10:ba01. What is the interface ID of the device?

0607:1234:aa10:ba01

ba01

2001:0DB8:75a3

2001:0DB8
The interface ID of an IPv6 address is the last 64 bits of the address. In this case, the IPv6 address listed is:

2001:0DB8:75a3:0214:0607:1234:aa10:ba01

The first 64 bits (the network prefix) are:

2001:0DB8:75a3:0214

And the last 64 bits (the interface ID) are:

0607:1234:aa10:ba01

So, the interface ID of the device with the IPv6 address 2001:0DB8:75a3:0214:0607:1234:aa10:ba01 is 0607:1234:aa10:ba01.

A high school in New York (school A) is using videoconferencing technology to establish student interactions with another high school (school B) in Russia. The videoconferencing is conducted between two end devices through the Internet. The network administrator of school A configures the end device with the IP address 209.165.201.10. The administrator sends a request for the IP address for the end device in school B and the response is 192.168.25.10. Neither school is using a VPN. The administrator knows immediately that this IP will not work. Why?

There is an IP address conflict.

This is a private IP address.

This is a loopback address.

This is a link-local address.
Navigation Bar
The IP address 192.168.25.10 is a private IP address, which is not routable over the internet. The internet routers are configured to discard the packets with private IP addresses as they are not meant to be used on the public internet. Therefore, the administrator knows that this IP address will not work for establishing the video conference.

What is one advantage of using the cut-through switching method instead of the store-and-forward switching method?

provides the flexibility to support any mix of Ethernet speeds

makes a fast forwarding decision based on the source MAC address of the frame

has a positive impact on bandwidth by dropping most of the invalid frames

has a lower latency appropriate for high-performance computing applications​
Navigation Bar
The advantage of using the cut-through switching method over the store-and-forward switching method is that it has lower latency appropriate for high-performance computing applications. In the cut-through switching method, the switch forwards the frame as soon as the destination MAC address is received, without waiting for the entire frame to be received. This results in lower latency but also means that there is a higher chance of errors due to lack of error checking. In contrast, the store-and-forward method checks the entire frame for errors before forwarding it, resulting in higher latency but fewer errors.
